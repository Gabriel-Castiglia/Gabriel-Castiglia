-  Hi, I’m @Gabriel-Castiglia
-  I’m mainly interested in Linux, and in the Python and C programming languages.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Linux distribution maintenance and development in the future.
-  How to reach me: mgcastiglia@proton.me
-  Fun fact: I started using Linux out of curiosity about its history, development, great security, and the freedom it offers. Now, I can't imagine using anything else for my programming projects and daily life.
