- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gabriel-Castiglia
- 👀 I’m mainly interested in Linux, and in the Python and C programming languages.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying with the book 'Dead Simple Python: Idiomatic Python for the Impatient Programmer' by Jason C. McDonald.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Linux distribution maintenance and development in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me: mathiascastiglia@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started using Linux out of curiosity about its history, development, great security, and the freedom it offers. Now, I can't imagine using anything else for my programming projects and daily life.
