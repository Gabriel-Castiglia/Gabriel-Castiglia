- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Gabriel-Castiglia
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mainly interested in Linux, and in the Python and C programming languages.
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Linux distribution maintenance and development in the future.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: gabriel.cstg@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I started using Linux out of curiosity about its history, development, great security, and the freedom it offers. Now, I can't imagine using anything else for my programming projects and daily life.
